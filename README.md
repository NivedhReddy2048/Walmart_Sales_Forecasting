# Walmart_Sales_Forecasting
Walmart Sales Analysis

Project Overview

This project aims to analyze Walmart sales data to uncover trends, seasonality, and key insights that impact sales performance. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and potential forecasting using machine learning models.

Dataset

The dataset contains historical sales data from Walmart, including attributes such as:

Date – The date of the sale

Store – Store identifier

Department – Department number

Weekly_Sales – Sales for the given store and department

Holiday_Flag – Indicator of whether the week includes a major holiday

Temperature – Temperature in the region

Fuel_Price – Cost of fuel in the region

CPI (Consumer Price Index) – Inflation rate representation

Unemployment – Unemployment rate in the region

Project Steps

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Converting date columns into proper datetime format

Feature engineering (e.g., extracting month and year from date)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understanding sales distribution

Identifying seasonality and trends

Analyzing sales during holidays vs. non-holidays

Correlation analysis between features

Data Visualization

Line plots for sales trends over time

Bar charts for sales per store/department

Box plots to examine outliers

Feature Engineering

Creating new time-based features

Normalizing/transforming numerical features if necessary

Modeling & Forecasting (Optional)

Time series analysis using ARIMA, LSTM, or Prophet

Regression-based sales prediction (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)

Requirements

To run this project, install the following dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels

How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/walmart-sales-analysis.git

Navigate to the project folder:

cd walmart-sales-analysis

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for analysis:

jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb

Results & Insights

The analysis reveals sales patterns across different stores and seasons.

Holiday weeks show significant spikes in sales.

Fuel prices and CPI have a moderate correlation with sales trends.

Future Work

Implementing advanced machine learning models for better sales prediction.

Developing a dashboard for real-time visualization.
